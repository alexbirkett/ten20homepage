#Background
As was announced in March, [ten20live](https://ten20live.com) will replace http://phonelocator.mobi. ten20live supports the Phonelocator for Android tracking app and hardware tracking devices.

The plan was not to add support for Phonelocator for Symbian OS to ten20live. This decision was made because Nokia is no longer making Symbian OS phones and [it's no longer possible to sign or deploy new versions of the Symbian OS app](http://developer.nokia.com/blogs/news/changes-to-supported-content-types-in-the-nokia-store)

We received some feedback on the [reddit forum](http://www.reddit.com/r/ten20/) and via email that there is interest in adding support for Symbian OS to ten20live.com. To do this the Phonelocator protocol would need to be re-implemented using
node.js, the platform used by ten20. (http://phonelocator.mobi was implemented using Ruby on Rails and Java)

So today we are launching a crowd funding campaign to add support to ten20 for the Phonelocator for Symbian OS.

#Funding goal
2 [bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) by June 30 2014

#Where should I send the Bitcoins?

#What will the funds be used for?
The funds will be used to develop a server for the Phonelocator for Symbian OS app using node.js.
The server will be licenced with the MIT open source licence and the source code hosted on [ten20 organisation on github](https://github.com/ten20)
The server will support associating the phone with the ten20live account and uploading its position.
Remotely altering app settings is not currently supported by the ten20live service.

#What will happen to http://phonelocator.mobi?
If the campaign is successful, we will keep http://phonelocator.mobi running until the new server for ten20 is ready.

#Will it be possible to integrate the server with a different GPS tracking platform?
Maybe, it's possible there is a bug in the Phonelocator app that means it will only connect to the Phonelocator server.

#Will you release the sourcecode to the Symbian OS app?
Yes, if the campaign is successful, and people want it. We're not sure how useful it will be as the [infrastructure to sign and deploy it is gone]((http://developer.nokia.com/blogs/news/changes-to-supported-content-types-in-the-nokia-store).

#What happen if the funding goal is reached by the end of June 2014?
The bitcoins will be returned to the addresses from which they were sent

We may be required to pay a small transaction fee to return the bitcoins. This should not be necessary if the amount paid is greater than 0.1 BTC. It might not be possible to return extremely small amounts of Bitcoin.

#Could you just run off with the money?
Yes, we could. We hope you will trust as not to as we have run http://phonelocator.mobi since 2008.

If the campaign fails, we can prove that the money was returned as all transactions in the bitcoin network are recorded in a public ledger know as the blockchain.

#What are Bitcoins?
Bitcoins are cash for the Internet.
Bitcoins can be used anywhere there is Internet access and are not controlled by any central institution. You can learn more about Bitcoin at [Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/).

#How much should I send?
That's up to you.

#How do I get bitcoins?
The most popular way to acquire is to buy them on a bitcoin exchange. There is a [list of exchanges here](http://howtobuybitcoins.info/).

We know of people who have had success buying bitcoins with [Justcoin](https://justcoin.com/) in Scandinavia and [Coinjar](https://www.coinjar.com/) in Australia.

We suspect that [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) is a pretty safe bet to buy bitcoins in the United States and elsewhere.

#How much time do I have?
Not much! It can take some time to open an account on a bitcoin exchange so if you want to participate start the process today!

#How much does a bitcoin cost?
The price is volatile. [Prices from Bitcoin average](https://bitcoinaverage.com/).

#Do I have to buy a whole bitcoin?
No, bitcoins are divisible down to 8 decimal places (0.00000001 BTC).

#How can I see how much money has been raised?
All transactions in the Bitcoin network are recorded in a distributed a public ledger. Current balance is available [here](https://blockchain.info/address/1NkfQE8cigQzsmrCsiExH1aH2S88mWzSXc)

#Why Bitcoins?
Using Bitcoins means that everybody can can participate irrespective of geography. We excited about Bitcoin because it has the potential to give people control over their money.

#Where do you store you private key?
The private key for the address [1NkfQE8cigQzsmrCsiExH1aH2S88mWzSXc](https://blockchain.info/address/1NkfQE8cigQzsmrCsiExH1aH2S88mWzSXc) was generated offline by a computer not connected to the Internet

#Can you issue and invoice / receipt?
Yes, if you provide an electronic signature that states it was you / your organisation that sent the money.
