#Background
We announced in March that, [ten20live](https://ten20live.com) will replace http://phonelocator.mobi. ten20live supports the Phonelocator for Android tracking app and hardware tracking devices.

#Crowdfunding campaign
We launched a [crowd funding campaign](/docs/save-phonelocator-for-symbian-os-crowdfunding-campaign) in June 2014.
The goal of the campaign was to raise 2 bitcoin to cover the cost of porting the Symbian Phonelocator protocol to node.js for use with ten20.
The goal was not met therefore [bitcoin that were contributed will be returned](https://blockchain.info/address/1NkfQE8cigQzsmrCsiExH1aH2S88mWzSXc).
We would like to thank the people that participated!

#Symbian app removed from Nokia Store
Phonelocator for Symbian has now been removed from the Nokia Store (Ovi).
