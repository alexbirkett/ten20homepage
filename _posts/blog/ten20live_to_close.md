The ten20live.com website will close 31st June 2015. The server software and the Android app are available on my [github account](https://github.com/alexbirkett). 


Phonelocator, which later became ten20live, started life as a motorcycle tracking app in 2007. 
Phonelocator and ten20 sadly never generated enough revenue to work on full time. 
Now due to other opportunities and commitments I feel that the time is right to close the site down.
My hope is that somebody else can take ten20live forward and build on it.
