Thanks for using the ten20live.com website (“Services”). The Services are provided by Birkett Enterprise Ltd. (“Birkett Enterprise”), located at 67a Branston Road, Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, DE14 3BY, United Kingdom.

By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.

#Using our Services

You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Do not misuse our Services, for example, do not interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content that you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

The [Privacy and cookie policy](/docs/privacy-policy) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Birkett Enterprise Ltd can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policies.

Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

#About Software in our Services

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may be updated automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

Birkett Enterprise Ltd grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by Birkett Enterprise Ltd as part of the Services. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Birkett Enterprise Ltd in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

Open-source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open-source licence that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open-source licence that expressly override some of these terms.

#Modifying and Terminating our Services

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

You can stop using our Services at any time, although we would be sorry to see you go. Birkett Enterprise Ltd may also stop providing Services to you or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

We believe that you own your data, and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to remove information from that Service.

#Our Warranties and Disclaimers

We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we do not promise about our Services.

Other than as expressly set out in these terms, neither Birkett Enterprise Ltd nor its suppliers or distributors makes any specific promises about the Services. For example, we do not make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services or their reliability, availability or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.

Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.

#Liability for our Services

When permitted by law, Birkett Enterprise Ltd and Birkett Enterprise Ltd’s suppliers and distributors will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages.

To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Birkett Enterprise Ltd and its suppliers and distributors for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount that you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you with the Services again).

In all cases, Birkett Enterprise Ltd and its suppliers and distributors will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable

We recognise that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms limits any consumers’ legal rights which may not be waived by contract.

#Business uses of our Services

If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Birkett Enterprise Ltd and its affiliates, officers, agents and employees from any claim, action or proceedings arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgements, litigation costs and legal fees.

#About these Terms

We may modify these terms, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retrospectively and will become effective no earlier than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

These terms govern the relationship between Birkett Enterprise Ltd and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

If you do not comply with these terms and we do not take action immediately, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

The courts in some countries will not apply English law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where English law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of England will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in England, then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the English courts, and you and Birkett Enterprise Ltd consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
